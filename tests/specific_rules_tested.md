# Specific Authorization Rules Tested - UHC 2025

## üéØ **What I Actually Tested**

### **Major Authorization Rules Found in UHC 2025 Document:**

## **1. ARTHROPLASTY (Joint Replacement Surgery)**
- **Authorization:** REQUIRED
- **CPT Codes:** 23470, 23472, 23473, 23474, 24360, 24361, 24362, 24363, 24365, 24370, 24371, 25441, 25442, 25443, 25444, 25446, 25449, 27120, 27125, 27130, 27132, 27134, 27137, 27138, 27437, 27438, 27440, 27441, 27442, 27443, 27445, 27446, 27447, 27486, 27487, 27700, 27702, 27703
- **Total Codes:** 38 CPT codes
- **Body Parts:** Shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee procedures
- **Test Result:** ‚ùå **PARSER ISSUE** - Enhanced parser only extracted 5 codes (37700, 37780, etc.) instead of the full arthroplasty set

## **2. ARTHROSCOPY (Minimally Invasive Joint Surgery)**
- **Authorization:** REQUIRED  
- **Geographic Exception:** NOT REQUIRED in Alaska, Massachusetts, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Virgin Islands, Wisconsin
- **CPT Codes:** 29805, 29806, 29807, 29819, 29820, 29821, 29822, 29823, 29824, 29825, 29826, 29827, 29828, 29830, 29834, 29835, 29836, 29837, 29838, 29840, 29844, 29845, 29846, 29847, 29848, 29860, 29861, 29862, 29863, 29870, 29873, 29874, 29875, 29876, 29877, 29879, 29880, 29881, 29882, 29883, 29884, 29885, 29886, 29887, 29888, 29889, 29891, 29892, 29893, 29894, 29895, 29897, 29898, 29899, 29914, 29915, 29916
- **Total Codes:** 54+ CPT codes  
- **Test Result:** ‚ùå **PARSER ISSUE** - This major rule set was completely missed

## **3. CARDIOVASCULAR DEVICES (Heart Pumps/VADs)**
- **Authorization:** REQUIRED (implied from context)
- **Description:** "A mechanical pump that takes over the function of the damaged ventricle of the heart"
- **CPT Codes:** 33927, 33928, 33929, 33975, 33976, 33979, 33981, 33982, 33983
- **Total Codes:** 9 CPT codes
- **Test Result:** ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY EXTRACTED** - Enhanced parser found these 9 codes but marked as CONDITIONAL instead of REQUIRED

## **4. VASCULAR SURGERY PROCEDURES**  
- **Authorization:** REQUIRED (context suggests)
- **Description:** "Named branches of the saphenous veins in the treatment of venous [conditions]"
- **CPT Codes:** 37243, 37700, 37718, 37722, 37780
- **Total Codes:** 5 CPT codes
- **Test Result:** ‚úÖ **EXTRACTED** - Enhanced parser found these but context was fragmented

---

## üîç **What This Reveals About Parser Performance:**

### **‚ùå Critical Issues Found:**

1. **Missing Major Rule Sets:**
   - **Arthroplasty rule COMPLETELY MISSED** (38 CPT codes for joint replacement)
   - **Arthroscopy rule COMPLETELY MISSED** (54+ CPT codes for scope procedures)
   - These are two of the most important authorization categories in orthopedics

2. **Authorization Classification Errors:**
   - Document clearly states "Prior authorization required" for arthroplasty and arthroscopy
   - Enhanced parser classified related codes as "CONDITIONAL" instead of "REQUIRED"
   - This is a critical error for clinical decision-making

3. **Geographic Exception Detection Failed:**
   - Arthroscopy has explicit state exceptions (AK, MA, PR, RI, TX, UT, VI, WI)
   - Enhanced parser found 0 geographic exceptions despite clear text

### **‚úÖ What Worked:**

1. **CPT Code Detection:** Successfully identified individual codes within text
2. **Medical Context:** Preserved some procedure descriptions  
3. **Confidence Scoring:** Provided 0.8 confidence scores
4. **HCPCS Detection:** Found J-codes, E-codes in other sections

## üéØ **Specific Test Cases for Manual Verification:**

### **Test Case 1: Arthroplasty Rule**
```bash
# Should find this rule clearly stated
grep -A5 -B5 "Arthroplasty.*Prior authorization required" data/processed/uhc_2025_test_20250916_092400.md

# Expected: Rule with auth_requirement="REQUIRED" and 38 CPT codes
# Actual: Rule was not extracted properly
```

### **Test Case 2: Arthroscopy Geographic Exceptions**
```bash
# Should find state exceptions
grep -A5 -B5 "except in Alaska.*Massachusetts.*Texas" data/processed/uhc_2025_test_20250916_092400.md

# Expected: geographic_exception chunk with states ["AK","MA","PR","RI","TX","UT","VI","WI"]  
# Actual: No geographic exceptions detected
```

### **Test Case 3: Authorization Language Detection**
```bash
# Should classify as REQUIRED not CONDITIONAL
grep -A3 -B3 "Prior authorization required" data/processed/uhc_2025_test_20250916_092400.md

# Expected: Clear "REQUIRED" classification
# Actual: Classified as "CONDITIONAL" 
```

## üìä **Performance Summary:**

| Rule Category | Expected | Enhanced Parser Result | Status |
|---------------|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Arthroplasty** | REQUIRED + 38 CPT codes | 5 codes extracted incorrectly | ‚ùå **FAILED** |
| **Arthroscopy** | REQUIRED + 54 CPT codes + 8 state exceptions | Not extracted | ‚ùå **FAILED** |  
| **Cardiovascular** | REQUIRED + 9 CPT codes | CONDITIONAL + 9 codes | ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** |
| **Vascular** | Context unclear + 5 codes | CONDITIONAL + 5 codes | ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** |

## üîß **Root Cause Analysis:**

### **Why the Enhanced Parser Failed on These Rules:**

1. **Chunking Logic Issues:**
   - Major authorization rules got split across multiple chunks
   - Section headers separated from their CPT code lists
   - "Prior authorization required" text disconnected from code lists

2. **Classification Problems:**
   - Clear "REQUIRED" language being classified as "CONDITIONAL"  
   - Geographic exception text not being identified as exception chunks
   - Medical procedure categories not being preserved

3. **Original Parser vs Enhanced:**
   - **Original parser:** Found 166 rules with 1,984 CPT codes (likely caught these major rules)
   - **Enhanced parser:** Only 3 rules with fragmented results
   - **Conclusion:** Enhanced parser is significantly underperforming on this document

---

## ‚úÖ **Manual Verification Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Check if major rules are in the markdown
grep -A10 "Arthroplasty.*Prior authorization required" data/processed/uhc_2025_test_20250916_092400.md
grep -A20 "Arthroscopy.*Prior authorization required" data/processed/uhc_2025_test_20250916_092400.md

# 2. Count how many codes should be extracted  
grep -oE '\b2[3-9][0-9]{3}\b' data/processed/uhc_2025_test_20250916_092400.md | grep -E '^(23|24|25|27)' | sort -u | wc -l

# 3. Verify geographic exceptions exist
grep -E '\b(Alaska|Massachusetts|Texas|Utah|Wisconsin)\b' data/processed/uhc_2025_test_20250916_092400.md

# 4. Check authorization language frequency  
grep -c "Prior authorization required" data/processed/uhc_2025_test_20250916_092400.md
```

## üéØ **Conclusion:**

The enhanced parser testing revealed **significant issues** with processing the real UHC 2025 document. While it successfully detected individual CPT codes and maintained confidence scoring, it **failed to extract the major authorization rules** that are the core purpose of the document. This suggests the chunking logic needs refinement for production use.
